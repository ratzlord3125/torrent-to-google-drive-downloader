# üì• Torrent to Google Drive Downloader (Colab)

**Updated: 2025/08/18**

This project allows you to **download torrent files or magnet links directly into your Google Drive** using Google Colab.  

- Add **one or more torrents**, view their details, reorder them, and change download settings.  
- Files are saved straight into your **Google Drive**, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about local storage.  
- Make sure you select the **T4 GPU runtime** in Google Colab before starting. This allows a cumulative download size of approx. **384GiB per session**.  

üëâ Even if you don‚Äôt understand code or output logs, just follow the instructions step by step and run each cell as guided in the notebook.
